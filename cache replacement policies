1.Least recently used (LRU)
Discards the least recently used items first. This algorithm requires keeping track of what was used when

1. Most recently used (MRU)
Discards the most recently used items first. When a file is being repeatedly scanned in a [Looping Sequential] reference pattern, MRU is the best replacement algorithm.
MRU cache algorithms have more hits than LRU due to their tendency to retain older data

3.Random replacement
Randomly selects a candidate item and discards it to make space when necessary. This algorithm does not require keeping any information about the access history.
It admits efficient stochastic simulation. we can use it as test benchmark.

4.Largest First/Smallest first
Discards the Largest size used items first/Discards the Smallest size used items first
