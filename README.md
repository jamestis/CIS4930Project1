A caching policy simulation to show the differences between policies under the same conditions. In essnesnce, requests arrive with rate lambda, while the size and distribution of files arrive with some variation of a pareto dist. I commmited over 90% of the code to this proj. 

Execution instructions:
python3 test.py

You will be prompted for an input. Type "Example" to run a hardcoded example case, and "Interactive" for custom value input.
A third option "Big Test" was used for procedurally generating plots, and contains the code to generate one of the final plots in the paper.
